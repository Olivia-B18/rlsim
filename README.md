# SnakeRL: Teaching Reinforcement Learning to Undergraduate Students

## About

The field of reinforcement learning is quickly growing and shows
much promise; however, many research papers exploring the topic
are too jargon-heavy for newcomers to understand RL or what it
is about.

The goal of this project is to make RL more accessible to newcomers
by building on the tool TrainYourSnakeAI developed by Hinojosa et al.,
which was presented at the ACM Conference SIGCSE TS 2025. While their
project introduced RL to middle school students using the game Snake,
my project seeks to reveal RL more in depth by exposing parameters involved
in the learning process and is geared towards undergraduate students.

## Installation

```
# Create a virtual environment with Python 3.12 (I used conda)
conda create -n sim python=3.12

# Install dependencies
pip install -r dependencies.txt
```

## TrainYourSnakeAI by Hinojosa et al.

Their repo has been copied into `hinojosa-snake` with minor changes from me
to make the tool run on MacOS. The small fixes I made were to:
* Commented out function in `game.py` to make Snake platform agnostic (runs on Windows, Linux, and now macOS too).
* Set port for Snake from default 5000 to 5001 since the default port is sometimes busy on macOS.
* Update the `hinojosa-snake/README.md` accordingly.

To run the Snake web app by Hinojosa et al.:

```
cd hinojosa-snake

python main.py

# MANUAL: open the port that loads in a browser <http://localhost:5001>
```

## SnakeRL Tool

Description TBD.

To run my Snake web app:

```
cd snake-plus-plus

python main.py

# MANUAL: open the port that loads in a browser <http://localhost:5001>
```
